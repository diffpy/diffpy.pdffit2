This code was derived from the first PDFFIT program by Thomas Proffen.
The sources were converted to C++ by Jacques Bloch and then extensively hacked,
extended and purged from most glaring bugs by Chris Farrow and Pavol Juhas.
This code is currently maintained as part of the DiffPy project to create
python modules for structure investigations from diffraction data.

The DiffPy team is located in the Billinge-group at the Applied Physics
and Applied Mathematics Department of the Columbia University in New York.
Currently the team consists of

    Simon Billinge

    Pavol Juhas

    Chris Farrow

    Emil Bozin

    Wenduo Zhou

    Peng Tian

    Timur Dykhne

that the list of contributors will expand with time.  Many thanks to
all current and future contributors!

DiffPy was initiated as part of the Distributed Data Analysis of Neutron
Scattering Experiments (DANSE) project, funded by the National Science
Foundation under grant DMR-0520547.  More information on DANSE can be

Acknowledgments
---------------

We are truly grateful to all the people who have contributed, in all
different ways, to this project:  Thomas Proffen, Xiangyun Qiu, Pete
Peterson and Jacques Bloch, previous Billinge-group members whose
contributions to the codes are living well beyond their affiliation with
the group; The hard working DANSE group at Caltech, University of
Maryland, Iowa State and University of Tennessee, especially Brent Fultz
for doggedly putting DANSE all together and Michael Aivazis, and the
indomitable Mike McKerns for their design input and MM's gargantuan
excel spreadsheets; The former members of the Billinge-group members,
especially HyunJeong Kim and Ahmad Masadeh for enthusiastic testing and
feature requests;  Last but not least, our long suffering family members,
and the whole coffee and tea industries at large, without whom none of
this would have been possible.
